# hash-creator

This project is designed for more advanced users (recommend having a good understanding of Python & Cryptography to fully understand what the program is doing).

This program allows the user to input a phrase and hash it in whichever algorithim they want.

Hashes are one-way functions, meaning they cannot be simply decrypted by the regular user. However, if you know what algorithim is used, you could reverse a hash or use tools to crack/reverse the hash, especially the weaker the algorithim.

For example, MD5 hashes are the weakest subset, you could theoretically crack them in under 5 minutes. However, in contrast with SHA512 (the longest and most secure as of current), could take you a long time to crack.

Always be aware of what you input into a program, this program cannot save information, only in memory, but some programs can and save a copy, so from a security perspective, you should always take caution when running programs!
